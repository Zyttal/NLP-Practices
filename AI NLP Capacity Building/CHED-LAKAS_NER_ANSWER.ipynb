And collectively, it was a great moment for the Denver Nuggets, watching a banner go high into the rafters.  Christian Braun and DeAndre Jordan allowed reporters to see and examine the bulky rings after the Nuggets took care of the Los Angeles Lakers in a 119-107 win before a sold-out and animated crowd. And the crowd, well, toward the end of Denver’s first win of the season, it chanted, “Who’s your daddy?” at the Lakers, an ode to a little trash talk from the championship parade in June.  For sure, there were plenty of extras Tuesday night as the curtain rose on another NBA season. But if there’s a message to be sent to the league, it’s this: These Denver Nuggets are for real, as if the championship they just won wasn’t enough of a hint. They are not a one-hit wonder.
